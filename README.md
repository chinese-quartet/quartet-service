# Quartet Service

The Quartet Project provides publicly accessible multi-omics reference materials and practical tools to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of multi-omics results. Well-characterized multiomics reference materials and quality control metrics pertinent to precision medicine study purposes can be used to measure and mitigate technical variation, enabling more accurate cross-batch and cross-omics data integration in increasingly large-scale and longitudinal studies such as the International Human Phenome Project.

## For Developer
### Prerequisites

1. You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.
2. Clone the `quartet-service` repo
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/clinico-omics/quartet-service.git

### How to develop a quartet-service plugin?

#### Quartet Service Plugin Manifest
```yaml
info:
  name: Quartet DNA-Seq Report
  version: v1.0.1
  description: Parse the results of the quartet-dna-qc app and generate the report.
  category: Tool
  home: https://github.com/clinico-omics/quartet-service-plugins
  source: PGx
  short_name: quartet-dnaseq-report
  icons:
    - src: ""
      type: image/png
      sizes: 192x192
  author: Jingcheng Yang
plugin:
  name: quartet-dnaseq-report
  display-name: Quartet DNA-Seq Report
  lazy-load: false
init:
  # Unpack any files to the specified directory, such as ENV/CONFIG/DATA directory.
  # You can write the unpack-env step more than once.
  - step: unpack-env
    # envname means the name of the file/directory in the resources directory, the file extension can be "tar.gz", "tgz" or "". When the envtype is environment, you need to keep envname same with the plugin name.
    envname: quartet-dnaseq-report
    # envtype can be the one of 'environment', 'configuration', 'data'
    envtype: environment
    # post-unpack-cmd can use template variables, such as {{ ENV_DEST_DIR }}, {{ CONFIG_DIR }}, {{ DATA_DIR }}
    post-unpack-cmd: 'FIXME: you can write any bash command'
  - step: load-namespace
    namespace: quartet-service.plugins.quartet-dnaseq-report
  - step: register-plugin
    entrypoint: quartet-service.plugins.quartet-dnaseq-report/metadata
  - step: init-event
    entrypoint: quartet-service.plugins.quartet-dnaseq-report/events-init
```

#### How to get the plugin context?

If you use `make-plugin-metadata` and `make-routes` to generate routes, then you can get the following variables from the handler's argument.

```clojure
{
  ;; All fields which you defined by `body-schema`, `query-schema`, `path-schema`
  :owner          "current user, maybe email or username."
  :workdir        "working directory, you can use it as the output directory."
  :uuid           "uuid is the part of workdir and maybe you need to use it to create a task."
  :plugin-context {:plugin-name "plugin-name"
                   :plugin-version "plugin-version"
                   :plugin-info "The content of tservice-plugin.yml"
                   :data-dir "The data directory of the specified plugin, you can generate the data into the directory, all data can be shared by generated tasks of the plugin."
                   :env-dir "The env directory of the specified plugin."
                   :jar-path "The jar path of the specified plugin."
                   :config-dir "The config directory of the specified plugin. When you need to access static files from the plugin, you can located these files into resources directory. Quartet service will copy all these files into config directory if you define a specified unpack-env step in tservice-plugin.yml."}
}
```
